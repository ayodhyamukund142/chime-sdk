/**
 * <p>Permanently bans a member from a channel. Moderators can't add banned members to a
 *          channel. To undo a ban, you first have to <code>DeleteChannelBan</code>, and then
 *             <code>CreateChannelMembership</code>. Bans are cleaned up when you delete users or
 *          channels.</p>
 *          <p>If you ban a user who is already part of a channel, that user is automatically kicked
 *          from the channel.</p>
 *
 *          <note>
 *             <p>The <code>x-amz-chime-bearer</code> request header is mandatory. Use the
 *                <code>AppInstanceUserArn</code> of the user that makes the API call as the value in
 *             the header.</p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { ChimeSDKMessagingClient, CreateChannelBanCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-chime-sdk-messaging"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { ChimeSDKMessagingClient, CreateChannelBanCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-chime-sdk-messaging"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new ChimeSDKMessagingClient(config);
