/**
 * <p>Deletes a channel flow, an irreversible process. This is a developer API.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p> This API works only when the channel flow is not associated with any channel. To get a list of all channels that a channel flow is associated with, use the
 *            <code>ListChannelsAssociatedWithChannelFlow</code> API. Use the <code>DisassociateChannelFlow</code> API to disassociate a channel flow from all channels. </p>
 *          </note>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { ChimeSDKMessagingClient, DeleteChannelFlowCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-chime-sdk-messaging"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { ChimeSDKMessagingClient, DeleteChannelFlowCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-chime-sdk-messaging"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new ChimeSDKMessagingClient(config);
 * const command = new DeleteChannelFlowCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
