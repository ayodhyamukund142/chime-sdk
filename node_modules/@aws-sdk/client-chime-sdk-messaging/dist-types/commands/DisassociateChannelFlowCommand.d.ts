 * <p>Disassociates a channel flow from all its channels. Once disassociated, all messages to
 *          that channel stop going through the channel flow processor.</p>
 *          <note>
 *             <p>Only administrators or channel moderators can disassociate a channel flow. The <code>x-amz-chime-bearer</code> request header is mandatory. Use the <code>AppInstanceUserArn</code>
 *            of the user that makes the API call as the value in the header.</p>

 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
